# List of first names and gender

The original database can be found inside the `original_data.zip` archive or downloaded [here](ftp://ftp.heise.de/pub/ct/listings/0717-182.zip).

## Syntax

The actual database `dict.csv` is a preprocessed file to decrease the total file size and read time.
The data is semicolon separated and consists of the column `name` and `gender`.
The column gender can be one of the following values:

Value | Description
---   | --- 
M     | male first name                                                             
1M    | male name, if first part of name; else: mostly male name
?M    | mostly male name (= unisex name, which is mostly male)
F     | female first name
1F    | female name, if first part of name else: mostly female name
?F    | mostly female name (= unisex name, which is mostly female
?     | unisex name (= can be male or female)
=     | Syntax for "equivalent" names <short_name> <long_name>
